# Goal of the ETL Lesson

The main goal of this ETL pipelines lesson is to take the [World Bank Project data set](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-bank-projects-operations) and merge this data with the [World Bank indicator data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). Then you'll load the merged data into a database.

In the process, you'll need to transform these data sets in different ways. And finally, you'll code an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load the data all in one step.
