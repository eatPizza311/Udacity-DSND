Natural Language Processing Pipeline
The 3 stages of an NLP pipeline are: Text Processing > Feature Extraction > Modeling.
- Text Processing: Take raw input text, clean it, normalize it, and convert it into a form that is suitable for feature extraction.
- Feature Extraction: Extract and produce feature representations that are appropriate for the type of NLP task you are trying to accomplish and the type of model you are planning to use.
- Modeling: Design a statistical or machine learning model, fit its parameters to training data, use an optimization procedure, and then use it to make predictions about unseen data.

This process isn't always linear and may require additional steps.
